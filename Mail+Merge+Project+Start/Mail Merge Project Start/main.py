##HINT 1 METHODS:
##1
## readline(): Return all lines in the file, as a [list] where each line is an item in the list object:
## f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
## Print(f.readlines(33))

##2
## string.replace(oldvalue, newvalue, count)
## txt = "I like bananas"
## x = txt.replace("bananas", "apples")

##3
## The strip() method removes any leading, and trailing whitespaces. Leading means at the beginning of the string, trailing means at the end.但保留中间空格，不会对正文造成影响
## string.strip(characters)
## txt = ",,,,,rrttgg.....banana....rrr"
## x = txt.strip(",.grt")
## -- print: banana
